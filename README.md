> Everything here is based on my own trial-and-error. While I've done my best to make these guides clear and safe, you are still modifying your phone at a deep level. Please understand that you are proceeding **at your own risk**. I can't be held responsible if things go sideways and you end up with a bricked phone or lost data. Be smart, be careful, and always have a backup!
